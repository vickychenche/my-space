                it has taught me many lessons and made me feel belonged. We play and pactice weekly and occasionally participate in tounrnaments. 
                What I love most about hockey is the team atosphere, both on and off the ice. Success in hockey isn't just about individual skillâ€”it's about the 
                bonds, trust, and cooperation among all the players. I belive this lesson extends well beyond the ice. </li>
