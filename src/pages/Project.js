        <h3> InDevConnect (Summer 2022)</h3>
        <body>
        This was one of my favourite project to work on! My team and I create a end product of Protoype using Figma. <br></br>
        We identified a problem space to help indie game devloper to get more exposure and researched a way to fix this problem. <br></br>
        We conducted surveys, interview and observation to identiy how we can approach the solution. <br></br>
        After deciding the direction we will go, we created our first low fadelity handrawn protoype. <br></br>
        After conducting workshop with potential users we finalized a desgined and created high fadelity figma protoype.<br></br>
